<h3>OOP Concepts, Final Touches on the Restaurant Page and Starting the Task Manager App</h3>

<p>
  Day 14 was packed with three main tasks: putting the polishing touches on the restaurant site, reviewing OOP concepts in JavaScript, and beginning my biggest project so far
  in the challenge
</p>

<p>
  Although I had really crossed the restaurant site off my todo list yesterday, I knew that I wanted to get the highlighting of active links more polished, add in responsive styles,
   and then tweaking the menu styles. Overall I am happy with how the project ended up, although I need to figure out the deployment with webpack, since it didn't work as smoothly on 
   GitHub pages as I had hoped.
</p>

<h3>OOP in JavaScript</h3>

<p>
  I also spend a couple hours reading documentation and articles about ES6 classes and general OOP programming in JavaScript. Since I've done a lot of OOP-focused coding the past
   year, it made it pretty easy to follow along and see where JavaScript OOP differs from languages like C# and Java I have used at school. To apply these concepts,
   the next project involved with moving forward with the Odin Project involves creating an advanced todo list app that contains project management features more akin to a Trello clone. 
   Since I use Trello daily, I am excited to make my own version and feel like it could end up being an awesome portfolio project once complete.
