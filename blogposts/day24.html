<h3>Day 24: Starting the Weather App</h3>

<p>
  Day 24 gave me a chance to start using promises and async/await in a new project.
</p>

<p>
  The next project on the docket is a simple weather app that pulls in data from the Open Weather API based on the city name provided in a searchbar. 
  While not especially challenging at first glance, I am sure there will be several hurdles, especially when a user is in the process of typing out characters, 
  but requests fire off after each keyup event. 
</p>

<p>
  I decided to go for a dark 'space' theme, and while styling won't be the highlight of my efforts here, I do plan to polish the app up overall. 
</p>

<p>Here is a snapshot of where the app is at so far: </p>
