<h3>YDKJS and Diving Into Promises</h3>

<p>
  Day 23 was focused on JS promises and async/await.
</p>

<p>
  Although today and yesterday felt less hands-on than I'd like, I think time was still well-spent diving into async programming in JS and reading a lot of You Don't Know JavaScript by Kyle Simpson. 
  I've read chapters 1-3 of the async book and, although a little intimidating at first, feel like I have a lot more appreciation for the issues and solutions for writing async code in JS.
</p>

<p>
  In testing the difference between traditional API requests with XMLRequest, then promises, and finally async/await, it is starting to make more sense how everything ties together. To start, I implemented a 
  basic giphy search app and played around with these 3 different ways to make API requests for data.
