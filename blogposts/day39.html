<h3>Day 39: Building a Social Media API with Node</h3>

<p>
  Today I spent time working on building the user and auth routes and logic using JWT for the large guitar education platform project.

  although I'm still going through the Odin Project curriculum with full enthusiasm, I was feeling a little uninspired to work on the React e-commerce project today, and instead decided to revisit an old 
  Udemy course focused on the MERN stack that I found initimidating when I tried going through it last summer. Rather than code along, I decided to customize the course project and use it as a reference to 
  develop the back end of what will be my biggest project to date - a guitar education platform. I really want to have a couple larger projects to bolster my portfolio, and since this has been a goal of mine for 
  months, I'm hoping to gradual build out the back-end API over the next few days, then apply my React skills to built out the front-end to be a full-stack MERN app that will (hopefully!) allow me to generate 
  some revenue eventually.
