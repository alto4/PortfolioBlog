<h3>More Webpack, JSON, ES6 Promises</h3>

<p>
  Day 22 was a mish-mash of more advanced JS concepts.
</p>

<p>
 Starting with the webpack demo tutorial provided on their website, I dove deeper into webpack and gained a greater appreciation for it's uses for managing assests, alongside compiling JS 
 code to be compatible across many browsers. I've heard stories about how challenging configuring webpack can be, and I got a bit of a taste that today!

  After spending a couple hours going through the webpack tutorial, I refreshed my memory of JSON methods in JS, and luckily this felt like a review since my head was still spinning from 
  the webpack demo. Overall today was a lot more focused on going through resources and coding along, so I'm looking forward to more project-focused work over the weekend to avoid losing momentum.
