<h3>Where I'm Coming From</h3>

<p><strong>Greetings!</strong> My name is Scott Alton and I've been learning how to code over the past 2 years.</p>

<p>
  I've learned from a range of different sources - spanning from Udemy, the Odin Project, and an online bootcamp called Altcademy, 
  as well as in a formal Computer Programming and Analysis program at Durham College.
</p>

<p>
  While I have found all of these resources to be valuable for expanding my skillset (to varying degrees of success), I feel most satisfied
  with my progress when I am building projects that are meaningful to my personal life. Although I have excelled in my college program thus far, I 
  feel that my learning has been too scattered, and that I am spreading myself too thin by trying to learn about so many languages at once when my true
  passion is working on the front end. As an example, in the last year I have bounced around from focusing on React and Rails last summer, to spending time with C#, PHP, C++ and Java for the fall, and then 
  more recently JavaScript, COBOL, C# and Java over the past few months. While I enjoy learning new syntax and broadening my horizens, I want to reign in 
  my priorities and focus primarily on become a full-stack JavaScript developer above all else with a special focus on the front end. 
</p>

<p>
  The other day, while trying to revisit the final sections of the online bootcamp I took last summer and left unfinished, I was trying to dive back into Ruby on Rails
  and, after spending many hours trying to debug issues deploying a React/Rails app to Heroku, had enough and decided that I no longer am reaping any benefits from jumping around so much.
  That is nothing against Rails (which I actually love and wish I had more opportunities to focus on), but rather is an issue with my attempt to learn everything 
  in the vast landscape of development, with no clear long-term goals beyond landing a job.
</p>


<h3>Where I Hope to Be</h3>

<p>
  Over the next 100 days, I want to be comfortable building full-stack JavaScript applications from the ground-up, with as little relience on tutorials and documentation as possible.
  My plan is to developer 4 main projects that I hope will become the focal points of my portfolio. I will summarize my broad plans for these 4 projects 
  below, but the main goal over the next 100 days will be to not copy code from tutorials and then tweak projects, but rather to take the new skills I learn, whether from
  documentation, Udemy courses, books, the like to apply these concepts into meaningful projects.
</p>

<p>
  Aside from having awesome projects that will make my life better, I hope that this focus will always propel my career, and allow me to successfully land a job in the field 
  that is both meaningful and challenging. 
</p>
