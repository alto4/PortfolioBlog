<h3>Day 47: Losing Steam and Shuffling Priorities</h3>

<p>
  Finding it hard to get into testing with Jest, I decided to change courses for the upcoming week.
</p>

<p>
  After a strange week of juggling different projects and trying to focus on Jest and TDD, it was clear to me today that it was just not something I have been feeling motivated with. This prompted 
  me to reassess where I'm at, with only a week left at my teaching job and two developer interviews this week. Ultimately, I decided it would be better to just take a week to focus on projects that 
  I am excited about, rather than force myself to continue with the Battleship project as a way to expand my knowledge of TDD. For the first time in a couple months, I felt truly burnt out with the Odin Project,
  and am going to revisit it in a week after building out the OpenGuitar project, styling my portfolio-blog, and polishing up/refactoring a few of my favourite projects from the ast 46 days.

<h3>Hitting a Stide with OpenGuitar</h3>

<p>
  The freedom of not having to guilt myself about avoiding the Odin Project curriculum made me feel really motivated to dive back into OpenGuitar, which I think will easily be my favourite project to 
  build out, both from a tech standpoint, and more importantly, as something that might actually make me money one day, or at the very least help me organizing my music teaching resouces and methods. Today I got 
  the forms to add a user profile working, and also added an index to show all user profiles. This felt really good, and I can see the MVP approaching quickly over the next few days.
