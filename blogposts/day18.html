<h3>Finishing up the Project Management App</h3>

<p>
  I spent a few hours today finishing up the logic and core functionality of the project management app. </p>

<p>
  This included polishing up the edit feature, tidying up the 
  code overall, ensuring that event listeners were appropriately added to and removed from elements, as well as connecting to localStorage for persistence. I also 
  added the exit strategies for abandoning a task or project entry, and overall am happy with how it feels. Most of these efforts actually went surprsingly smooth - with a couple notable exceptions. 
</p>

<p>
  Implementing persistence with localStorage seemed too good to be true, and sure enough it was. The issue that I faced was that event listeners were not properly working with stored projects and tasks. 
  This was because parsing the JSON data from localStorage into objects didn't explicitly cast them into Project or Task instances. Therefore, the class methods were being called without any association. 
</p>

<p>
  Anothing cool thing I learned was using the replaceChild method to swap out the add button with the edit buttons on both the task and project forms without having to do a bunch of work 
  to avoid event delegation conflicts using a shared input form.
</p>

<p>
  Tomorrow I plan to put the final touches of the project, with an emphasis on improving the UI design and ironing out any existing kinks (including issues with the mark complete/incomplete when working with 
  data render from localStorage entries).
</p>

<p>Here is a sample of where the project is currently at: </p>
