<h3>An Interview and More JavaScript Objects</h3>

<p>
  Today was slightly less productive from a coding perspective, although not wasted by any means! 
  I felt a bit unfocused throughout the day leading up to a second-round interview I had with a digital media agency,
  but still found time to finish off the basic functionality of the Music Library application.

  The interview seemed to go fairly well, and just like the first round, both interviewers were very friendly, but also quite thorough. 
  My impression of the job is that, while not the highest paying position, it seems like it would give me plenty of opportunity to broaden my skills
  and gain more practical experience in larger projects. While my fingers are crossed, if nothing else, I will be happy to have made it to the second round,
  and it felt good just to have a company ackowledge my application - let alone give 2 hours of their time to get to know me!

<h3>Project 2: Library Application</h3>

<p>
  At the end of Day 3, I had simply set up the constructors and basic functions for the application, and today times was spent adding a form, 
  basic validation checks to ensure all fields are filled out, as well as adding delete and toggle read/unread buttons. While not overly complicated, 
  I feel good about the amount I was able to accomplish in a short period of time, having added the core functionality in less than an hour and a half.
