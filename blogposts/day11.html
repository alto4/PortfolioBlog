<h3>ES6 Modules, Webpack and Starting the Restaurant Site</h3>

<p>
  Day 11 was focused on revisiting webpack and becoming more familiar with ES6 modules. 
</p>

<p>
 Although I've been using ES6 modules and webpack in my experiences with React and Node, it feels a lot more comfortable diving into the documentation now that 
 I know where they fit into the bigger picture, and it definitely felt worth my time to revisit the underlying concepts and use-cases for each. While I've heard 
 plenty of horror stories related to webpack configuration, I kept it pretty basic for now and basically just followed through the docs on the webpack site. 
</p>

<h3>Getting Started with the Restaurant Site</h3>
<p>To get more practical experience with these new(ish) tools, I began building out the dynamic restaurant page challenge via the Odin Project, which requires a 
  SPA that dynamically renders each 'page' of the website using the tabbed-page design style using webpack and ES6 modules. Overall I think this will be a solid portfolio 
  project that I will try to really expand and polish-up, since this is the type of site that I would love to be building for work!
