<h3>Day 40: Continuing the Social Media API with Node</h3>

<p>
  Today was a split between continuing work on the Node API started yesterday and continuing the React/Typescript shopping cart project.
</p>

<p>
  Today was a split effort. I spent a few hours getting the guitar platform profile and lesson routes sorted out, with lots of testing using Postman. Although I used to find Postman 
  kind of a pain to use, I have to say that gaining a bit more practice testing API routes the past 2 days, I have really grown to appreciate it. Since I am going through a Udemy course 
  to give me an idea of each important step, but customizing the routes and models, I feel like I am learning a lot just by making silly errors and having to troubleshoot, but with more 
  broad guidance on how to approach creating an API from scratch with Node, Express, and MongoDB.

<h3>Picking Away at the Shopping Cart</h3>

<p>I felt like I was losing steam with my React e-commerce/shopping cart project. After a day away from it, I came back feeling refreshed and eager to keep it moving forward. This involved adding buttons 
  to alter the quantity of items, checking if items are already in the cart to increase quantity rather than allow for duplicate entries, and create the remove buttons. This took some thinking to pass 
  state between various components, and although my decision to use Typescript seemed to make this even more challenging, I am glad to be learning about it alongside React and am starting to really see it's benefits. 
  I also added a total for the cart using a reduce function (which I always have to look at the docs for), and added routes that take in an item ID that bring a user to an item details page. 
</p>

<p>Although there is still some work to be done with the item details pages and overall styles, as well as adding a footer and some dummy content to the homepage, I can see the end approaching for 
  my biggest React project to date!
