<h3>Day 28: Diving Deeper into the Resume Generator Project</h3>

<p>
  Today I spent most of my efforts building out the resume generator app, including adding the form to input entries for the experience and education sections
</p>

<p>
  Overall this went quite well once I decided to keep the state of both forms independent to that component, generate an object, then pass that up to the resume 
  component. I think this is a good approach and overall I'm pretty happy with the progress made in a couple hours wiring up the form submission logic and getting 
  it to look decently similar to a proper resume in format.
