<h3>Kicking It  Off</h3>

<p>
  When trying to figure out what to start with today to kick off the challenge, I immediately felt overwhelmed with choices. This is a typical feeling,
  so I decided that I would consult a familar resource for direction when I needed project ideas: <strong>The Odin Project</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  I really got on a role with the Odin Project during the beginning of last summer. I had nearly finished off the Fundamentals track when I decided to enrol 
  in the Altcademy bootcamp online. One thing I loved about the Odin Project was the challenge of building things with little-to-no hand holding. I recall getting
  stuck at the calculator project and deciding that I needed more guidance with JavaScript. Whether or not I jumped the gun is unknown, but I am certain that between
  a solid amount of JavaScript experience in Altcademy, personal projects, as well as a course taken at Durham College in my last semester that I would have a better 
  approach to getting the calculator up and running.

<h3>Project 1: JavaScript Calculator</h3>

<p>
  While a seemingly simple challege, I thought that it would be a confidence-booster to come back to a project I struggled with a year ago, and immediately 
  upon starting up the project it came back to me where I had gotten stuck last summer. The issue I had was processing multiple calculations, beyond those with 
  just a single operator. I could be mistaken, but I feel like the directions for the project are now more detailed - where last summer I remember struggling with
  getting my calculator to follow the order of operations, it now elaborates that when more than one operator are present, to simply calculate the first operation, 
  and use the resulting total as the first number in the next operation. 
</p>

<p>
  I quickly got a basic UI going and wired the events with ease, until I reached the point where I had to deal with consecutive operations. Although it took me 
  a bit of thought and trial/error, the simplest solution to this issue was to check if a previous operator had been acknowledged, and if so trigger the same functionality
  that the equals button performed. This was a simple solution, and I don't remember the details of my train of thought from a year ago, but now that this issue has been solved,
  I feel like the rest of the functionality will be relatively smooth sailing moving forward.
