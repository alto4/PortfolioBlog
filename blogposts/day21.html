<h3>Form Validation</h3>

<p>
  Day 21 revolved around form validation and felt smooth, since I've done it before with several different languages.
</p>

<p>
 Validation came up in at least 5 of my courses at Durham College, where pretty much every web development class ended up having a registration and login 
 system as the core feature for the sake of learning. Offhand, I recall dealing with validation and sticky forms with PHP, then in ASP.NET, and more recently in 
 JSPs (Java), and finally JavaScript. With that in mind, today felt like a good review, and it was neat to learn about the built-in validation API included in JS, 
 which I had never heard about previously.

<p>
  I also found using regular expressions to be a lot less initimidating, since I have dealt with them quite a bit in the past 6 months. I found using publically shared 
  regex's for the email and postal code validation to be the easiest and most customizable way to achieve the results I was looking for. Overall I feel that with the 3 
  small components built yesterday and the contact form built today, I am starting to accrue a nice collection of reusable components that will be handy in many projects to come.

<p>Here is a snapshot of the register page I have been working on with client-side validations. </p>
