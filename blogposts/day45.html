<h3>Day 45: Even More Jest and Finish Up OpenGuitar Authentication</h3>

<p>
  Today was focused on exploring more advanced topics in Jest as well as the role of mocking in TDD.

<p>
  Although I enjoyed yesterday's efforts writing tests and then writing code to make them pass one by one, reading about testing continues to be fairly boring. Not that I think it isn't useful, but most articles
  seem to just reiterate how important it is to test one functionality at a time and the importance of keeping tests simple and unreliant on other functionalities. Fortunately, I got through all 
  the videos and articles for this section today, so starting tomorrow it will be full speed ahead with a Battleship game using Jest for testing and React.

<h3>Working with Redux for the OpenGuitar Platform</h3>

<p>
  I continued further with the OpenGuitar platform this aft, and nearly completed the login and registration pages aside from styles, by implementing the login calls to the auth API, as well as making the navbar 
  dynamic and adding the ability to logout. I found it much easier to work with Redux and JWTs this time, since the steps were very similar to creating the registration, where after a successful form submit, a token is 
  saved to localStorage and the user is forwarded to a dashboard. Tomorrow will be focused on creating the dashboard, which will be one of the larger efforts of getting an MVP up for OpenGuitar.
