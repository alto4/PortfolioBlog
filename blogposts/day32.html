<h3>Day 32: React Hooks and Refactoring</h3>

<p>
  Today I spent time diving into the docs for React Hooks and refactored the resume generator app to use functional components. 
</p>

<p>
  When I've tried using React in the past, it was usually pretty rushed as I tried to learn everything at once as I went. This approach didn't work, since I spent so much time jumping between 
  languages and environments the past year, so taking the time to really go through the top-notch documentation, and being armed with a more advanced knowledge of ES6 and Async JS, has been 
  far more productive.

<h3>Refactoring the Resume App</h3>

<p>
 Although a little tedious, refactoring every component from classes to functional components using hooks was pretty smooth overall, and I feel like the process of just writing so much useState 
 statements, and having to go through line-by-line to remove this.state, and this from hundreds of lines really made me understand the differences between the two styles of writing React. There is 
 still a bit of final work to be done on the parent Resume component, which is currently overwriting in weird ways, but otherwise each contained section has been successfully refactored.
