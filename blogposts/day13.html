<h3>Finishing the Restaurant Page MVP</h3>

<p>
  Day 13 was spent putting together the final touches to meet the minimum requirements of the restaurant site using ES6 modules and webpack.
</p>

<p>
Today felt very productive filling up the menu and contact views of the restaurant site. Now that most of the routing/dynamic rendering has been sorted out, 
it felt quite trivial to create a bunch of new elements in the DOM, and then style them accordingly. Having a tiny amount of experience with EJS and React, 
it made a lot of sense to meet to create a templating function for menu items, and dynamically create item cards in the DOM based on the contents of an array of objects.
</p>

<p>
  There are definitely some polishing touches that I'd like to make to the restaurant page from a UI perspective. I plan to gradually add these in over the next few days,
  but overall feel the vast majority of work is done. Important to me, is that I think the site actually looks like something I'd pitch to a potential client, although I would 
  likely avoid creating every single element dynamically with JavaScript (which was a great exercise, but also incredibly tedious). Tomorrow I am going to reach out to a few local restaurant-home-starter 
  and food trucks to see if anyone is interested in a free customized page. Ideally, I'd love to add a couple real projects to my portfolio, as well as expand my network and potentially get a reference or 
  two out of it.
