<h3>Dropdowns, Hamburger Menus and Image Slides</h3>

<p>
  Day 20 was a nice break from big projects and documentation, and involved practicing my JS chops with 3 classic UI features.
</p>

<p>
  All 3 features (the dropdown menu, the mobile hamburger menu, and the image slider) were straightforward enough to code, although I've never done so from scratch 
  beyond a simple mobile menu, and instead have always just used Bootstrap components. I felt that these were all good challenges that I might see in a front-end developer 
  interview or technical challenge, and could really feel the momentum building as I got the the hardest one, the image carousel/slider.
</p>

<p>
  I am satisfied with the outcome of today's efforts, and will in the future revisit these 3 challenges to make them into styled components, which will be handy to have around 
  for many future projects and can be easily customized/expanded as needed.
