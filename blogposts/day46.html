<h3>Day 46: Recipe App</h3>

<p>
  To take a break from Jest, I spent the day revisiting the recipe sharing app project using Node and Express.

  The past week has easily been the least productive in a while for working through the Odin Project JS curriculum. While I was dissapointed with myself 
  for not being able to focus on Jest and the Battleship project with full enthusiasm, I decided to instead push forward with the OpenGuitar platform and the 
  recipe sharing project. Although I plan to fully dive back into Jest on Monday, I think this is a reasonable way to feel after so much excitement flying through 
  projects for the first 40 or so days of this challenge, and it seems natural to be less motivated with TDD using Jest.

  A lot of progress was made in just two hours today on the recipe app, and the functionality to edit and see recipe details was added, as well as a few tweaks made to 
  the models of the recipe to accomodate more details than previously accounted for. Overall, I feel constantly more comfortable with Node and the flow of data, and I 
  enjoy working with a partner as a nice change of pace to coding entirely on my own.
