<h3>Doing It Live! via Heroku</h3>

<p>
  Day 7 felt like as good a time as any to deploy this blog/portfolio site to share with the world. This became especially clear when I was trying to 
  feature select projects on my resume, and really wanted to show something current that demonstrates my most recent interest in full-stack JavaScript development. 
  I knew there would be a few hurdles to overcome getting this hosted live, and luckily it wasn't as much of a challenge as I had anticipated.

  The main step was to switch to a MongoDB Atlas database and add my existing blog posts to the hosted collection. This went very smoothly, as I've done 
  it a few times. A few issues arose with the port I was calling for in my server.js file, as well as a few broken images due to case mismatches (my Snipping 
  Tool always saves screenshots as JPG in uppercase, which Heroku didn't seem to like). Overall though, after an hour of effort, I am happy to have this blog online and 
  ready to share! I think that just knowing that it's now live and accessible by anyone makes me feel inspired to really spend time making it look nice, and also 
  to go back and tidy up some of the poor writing/spelling that's resulted from writing these reflections too quickly late at night.
