<h3>TicTacToe using Factories and Modules</h3>

<p>
  Day 8 (plus the later hours of Day 7) were spent getting started with the TicTacToe project, which is to be built using the module and factory function design patterns.

  Although I've had a bit of exposure to the concept of closures, I really felt like the underlying concepts of scope and closures clicked when I was working through the articles
   and documentation used throughout the section. I was successful in quickly getting the gameboard set using the module pattern, and also has a pretty easy time getting the checks 
   for declaring a winner or draw. Where I forsee issues, and have already experienced a few, is in trying to call methods encapsulated within other modules/factories.

<p>I think because so much of the coding I've done has been OOP-based, it is a little hard to take a step back and implement these design patterns. I am planning to spend as much time as needed tomorrow
  to better organize my code, get the end of game logic working (without a hard refresh of the page using window.location - which feels like a poor choice currently), as well as getting the player creation forms 
  to work. Seeing some of the other project fellow coders have produced for this challenge has been really inspiring. Ideally, I want to make this project feel really polished, both in terms of the logical flow,
   as well as in regards to the UI. I plan to really dive into it tomorrow morning, and am excited to get it working and put together.
