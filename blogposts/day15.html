<h3>Diving Headfirst Into the Task Manager App</h3>

<p>
  I woke up with the task manager app on my mind, and plenty of concerns about my ability to do the project. Luckily, 12 hours later I feel much better!
</p>

<p>
  Similar to the restaurant page, I really wanted to make something I am proud to take ownership of in my portfolio, and since I use a combination of to-do list apps,
  and Trello every day, I think that this will be a good app for me to really increase the scope of these projects. I have built basic to-dos,
  pomodoro apps, and and weather apps previously, and while they were all good learning experiences, were never projects I got especially excited about. My hope with this project 
  is that I can bring together a bunch of upcoming tasks from the Odin Project - namely the dynamic user interfaces section involving sliders, hamburger menus, and dropdown menus 
  using just vanilla JS and CSS, and the weather app. Most importantly, I really want to take a few days to style all of my projects to date over the past 2ish weeks, as well as this blog. 
</p>

<h3>CRUD</h3>

<p>
  Although I will need to refactor my code thus far in the Trello clone/life manager project, I am pretty impressed with my efforts today and feel like I established a really strong momentum. 
  I woke up worried that I would get stuck dealing with CRUD actions between many project task lists, but luckily it went smoothly overall. Once I decided to treat this project with more seriousness 
  of building something I will use daily, based on Trello but with added features that will unify my efforts over the next month or so, I feel a lot more excited about building this out.
