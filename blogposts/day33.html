<h3>Day 33: Finishing the Refactoring and More Hooks</h3>

<p>
  I woke up today knowing that there were a few issues with my refactoring to functional components yesterday so I spent time fixing that first. 
</p>

<p>
  Although I went through refactoring to use hooks/functional components yesterday pretty quickly and seemingly smoothly, I knew a few bugs had to be dealt with in my parent Resume component. 
  Fixing that was my primary goal for today, and luckily that was easily accomplished.

<h3>Beginning the Memory Card Game</h3>

<p>
 I've been thinking of trying to build a sheet music/theory project for a while, and decided to make that my focus in the next project - a memory card game. Today I simply got the project structure setup, took a 
 collection of screenshots of different images, and mapped over them to make sure the assets would be usuable.
