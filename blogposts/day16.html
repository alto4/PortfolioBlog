<h3>Starting a Long-Term Project</h3>

<p>
  Today went entirely astray from my initial gameplan of focusing on the design of the Project Management App, but I think ultimately it was for the better!

  While the Odin Project has provided a really good framework for me to strive towards constant progress in the form of completing challenging projects, I have been growing
  more and more aware of my need to build out bigger projects that are meaningful.

<h3>Guitar School Ambitions</h3>

<p>After teaching for 10ish years, and especially with my teaching largely moving online this past year or so with COVID-19, I have been trying to think of ways to merge my 
  current career as a teacher with my next career focus as a developer. Today, after reading through the docs for webpack and then React, an idea came to me to write a sort of 
  "documentation" for learning to play guitar. In other words, a no-nonsense method book broken down with clear teaching points. Since I've been doing a lot of video lessons, the 
  barrier of setting up the logistical side of recording a video series has taken care of myself, and I feel that it would make sense to record broadcasted lesson tutorials, rather than just 
  put all my effort into making one for an individual student who, at best, might only use it for a week or two for reference. 
</p>

<p>I see a lot of ideas emerging with this type of site - including a subscription service, built-in apps such as interval trainers and interactive chord dictionaries, as well as a 
  live video streaming platform similar to Zoom. Although it's only a start with mocked up data, I am hopeful this site will really inspire me to apply my skills towards something that will both 
  help people learn guitar, as well as potentially contribute to a passive income one day, all while helping me to bolster my portfolio.
