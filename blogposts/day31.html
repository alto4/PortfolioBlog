<h3>Day 31: Recipe App React Lifecycle Methods</h3>

<p>
  Today was focused on learning more about React lifecycle methods and connecting a recipe app to MongoDB.
</p>

<p>
  I started the day working on a recipe app project with my friend Nick that we talked about doing while still in classes. We have set up a basic server with routes last time we met, and 
  today we connected the server to MongoDB, and got the UI to render recipes pulled in using Mongoose and MongoDB Atlas. I know server-side JS is the focus of the Odin Project later on 
  in the Full-Stack JavaScript curriculum, but it feels good to have a head-start on the content, since I've already worked with Node/Express/MongoDB a bit.

<p>
  Although I didn't find lifecycle methods to be the most exciting topic as far as coding goes, it makes more sense to me how components are added, updated, and removed from the DOM. 
  I'm excited to get into hooks, and will definitely plan to spend a few days really understanding them.
