<h3>Regaining Focus with the Project Management App</h3>

<p>
  Today I tried to regroup after veering off-course yesterday getting carried away with the Guitar School site. While that's something that I will complete gradually, I decided 
  to isolate my efforts moving forward to only working on the guitar site on weekends to avoid losing momentum with the Odin Project.

<h3>Styles and Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>
  Although good progress was being made with the Task Manager app before yesterday, I was a little unsure of what to tackle next. Today, I decided to make a list of remaining tasks 
  based on what was left to at least get the major requirements complete. Here's what I came up with.

<p>Tomorrow I will begin with the refactor, and then move onto the complete/incomplete buttons. Afterwards, I will work on the dynamic menus. If time allows, I will also start saving 
  data into localStorage.
