<h3>Refactoring TicTacToe</h3>

<p>
  Day 9 efforts started with reassessing my use of the module design pattern, extracting all functionality to the global scope, then re-encapsulating into a better logical flow.
</p>

<p>
  Once the gameboard functionality, and all associated event listeners, were functioning, I proceeded to add the playerFactory function, and then tie everything together in a controller IIFE.  
</p>

<p> 
  It took some effort to get the flow of events, but with a bit of persistence, I am happy with the functionality and implementation of design patterns used. Through trial and error, I feel 
  far more comfortable with them. I plan to take an hour tomorrow to add some polishing touches to the UI design and tidy up the code.
