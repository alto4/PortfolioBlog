<h3>Getting In the Zone</h3>

<p>
  After so many months of hand-holding and completing overly guided projects for school, it was refreshing to work on a project with clear high-level requirements, but little guidance. 
  The calculator project felt right in my comfort zone and definitely has been a confidence-booster. Today was spent adding more functionality to the UI,
  including a backspace and digit button, as well as keyboard events and ensuring that certain circumstances didn't expand the display beyond its specified width.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p>
  Although I felt good about completing the core requirements, it was a great review of JavaScript fundamentals, and there were a few things I looked up to refresh myself on syntax.
  These included the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Keyboard events - I needed a refresher on how to get the values of a pressed key after initially overcomplicating things</li>
  <li>Switch statements - I couldn't remember how to trigger the same results for various conditions. In this case, trying to trigger a click event on the equals 
    button for both the Enter key and Equals('=') key.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Result</h3>
<p>
  Overall, I was happy with the result of this first project. The UI is simple, but user-friendly, and I think I did a pretty good job of addressing the many bugs that 
  arose during testing. I'm sure more will arise when I check again in the future, but overall I feel ready to move on without getting too hung up on small details (i.e. adding
  more operator buttons and FontAwesome icons).
