<h3>Finishing TicTacToe</h3>

<p>
  Day 10 was focused on tidying up the styles for the TicTacToe project and diving into ES6 classes.

<p>
 Today, I spent just under an hour improving the design for TicTacToe and tying up a few loose ends to polish the project to the point I felt comfortable moving on. 
 Although I had technically declared the project done yesterday, I woke up and decided that it wasn't clean enough to belong in my portfolio, and therefore wanted 
 to polish up the UI. I had big ideas initially to add humorous images or an overall theme to make the project more unique, but ultimately decided to just
  stick to a simple blank and white interface that was clean and consistent, and greatly improved once changing to a new font.
