<h3>Continuing the Restaurant Site using ES6 Modules and Webpack</h3>

<p>
  The bulk of my efforts on Day 12 were spent debugging the front-end 'routing' using webpack and modules.
</p>

<p>
Going into the restaurant page project, I had a feeling that getting the dynamic contents 'routes' based on user clicks and keypresses would be the hardest part. 
This ended up being an accurate feeling, and today was largely spent just trying to get the interactions to call the right render functions and keep all navbar event 
listeners in tact.  
</p>

<p>
  After a lot of trial and error, I got things working in terms of rendering the proper content, as well as highlight only the currently displayed content in the navbar.
  Although I got discourage temporarily a few times after going down a rabbit hole only to encounter the same issues, or worse yet, creating more issues, overall I feel like 
  this was exactly what I needed to experience to really get the hang of modules and a more in-depth understanding of the nuances of front-end routing. I can definitely see 
  how these concepts will come into play in future days using React, and I am looking forward to making this project something I am truly proud of and comfortable showing off in my portfolio.
