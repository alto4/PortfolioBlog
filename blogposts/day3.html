<h3>Heroku Deployment and JavaScript Objects</h3>

<p>
  Today's efforts were split between trying to deploy a large project I had built for school to Heroku and then moving forward into the Full-Stack JavaScript 
  track of <strong>The Odin Project</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Project: Deploying a Custom CRM with PHP and PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>
  For my Web Development - Intermediate class at Durham College, we were tasked to build out a custom CRM system with an expanding list of features. This was my first
  large-scale full-stack application, and was built with PHP and PostgreSQL. Overall I feel like I really went the extra mile with mine to make the required features realistic 
  and functional. Highlights for the project include complete authentication and authorization, password encryption, prepared statements, account management features from a site 
  adminstrator account, and client communications management forms.  
</p>

<p>While I still plan to customize and build out the project's front end even more to be a full-fledged music studio management solution, the main issue I have faced with the 
  project is deploying it online, since my server access through the college ended a couple weeks ago. The solution I found was to deploy a PostgreSQL database on Heroku using a hobby
  development server, and fortunately this went surprisingly smooth! I am proud to say that the project is officially online at this <a href="https://peaceful-fortress-72665.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">link</a>.

<h3>Project 2: Library Application</h3>

<p>
  Diving into the Full-Stack JavaScript path on the Odin Project, my first lesson was in classes and prototypical inheritance. I recall finding these topics very confusing at first months ago,
  but now that I have done plenty of object-orientated programming in C# and Java through school, it felt very digestable and easy to understand articles about JavaScript objects and constructors.
</p>

<p>
  The project presented to apply knowledge of JavaScript classes involves a library application that allows a user to add books to their records, and displays them with options for removal, or marking as read/unread. 
  Ideally, I hope to expand/tweak this project to be a sheet music library that I can work into the Music Studio CRM mentioned above.
