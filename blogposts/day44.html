<h3>Day 44: More Jest</h3>

<p>
  Today was focused on writing tests for basic algorithms with Jest, then solving them.
</p>

<p>
  After a couple days with Jest, I feel like it's starting to click when and where to write tests, and overall the workflow of writing, then making the tests pass is fairly 
  straighforward. It was also a nice way to break down mentally a few algorithms that I struggled with months back, especially the Caesar's Cipher algorithm, and take it one step
  at a time. This slow but effective approach to solving problems is something that I feel like I've been honing well over the past month and a half, and while not the most exciting 
  in terms of output over the past few days, it is clear to me why people are so passionate about TDD and unit testing in general.

<h3>Setting Up Redux for the OpenGuitar Platform</h3>

<p>
  To break up the Odin Project curriculum on Jest and Testing in JS, I decided to continue on with the front end of the OpenGuitar platform today, and since basic components and layouts 
  are already set up, the next step was to add Redux, which is entirely new to me. I have to admit that I felt a little lost in the boilerplate it took to get setup, and it was also a bit different 
  working with the Redux Dev Tools, but overall I can see the benefits compared to constantly lifting state up and passing props down. While not much to look at in terms of the login and registration
  pages, I was happy to get the API errors to show as alerts, and overall am excited about where this project will take me.
