<h3>Day 41: Finishing the Social Media API with Node</h3>

<p>
  Today was spent finishing up the post and lesson routes for the Guitar education platform API.

<p>
  Based of Brad Traversy's MERN Stack Front to Back course, I continued building out the backend API for the guitar platform, and have been tweaking and expanding upon the course 
  code to suit my needs for the platform. The lesson and post routes were the most substantial amount of work so far, since each tracks users that make comments and subscribe to 
  certain courses, and there were quite a few routes related to various user interactions. After lots of testing I am happy with how things have turned out, and although I'm sure 
  changes will be required once I start building out the front end, I am confident that this will be a good foundation to build on.
