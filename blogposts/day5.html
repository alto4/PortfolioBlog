<h3>Continuing Project 2: Library Application</h3>

<p>
  Day 5 involved a few rabbit holes with moving the library project forward. Since I was feeling a little off today, I decided to get momentum going by trying
  to tidy up the styles and ease into my day. I then fell into a familiar loop of styling a new project, deciding I was unhappy with it, then starting from scratch.

  Once I decided I was spending too much time making artistic/design decisions, I decided to just use the Spotify design as inspiriation, since it's UI that 
  I've always admired for it's simplicity and 'cool-looking' colour scheme. Fortunately, that went a little better with a bit of inspiriation, and then I dove back into the code.

  One feature that was not a requirement, but that just seemed neccessary to spice up the application, was to add images for the book cover. I went back and forth between having a user upload their own images,
  and pulling in images from a third-party API. Ultimately, I decided on the latter, since I thought it would be nice to allow the user to be shown their books cover with a simple ISBN entry in the form. 
  While not entirely complete (as you can clearly see below due to the repeated cover), now that images are being effectively pulled in, I am pretty confident that tomorrow I will simply be able to add a form 
  field for the user to input the ISBN number, and pass that into the function I am using to retrieve images from the Open Library API.
