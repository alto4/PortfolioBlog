<h3>Day 26: Hello (Again!) React</h3>

<p>
  Officially finished the first half of the Odin Project JavaScript course, today was a pivot into React. 
</p>
  Today was largely spend going through the React documentation and practicing the basics. I had spent a few weeks last summer getting into the framework, but 
  sadly my efforts were a bit rush, and then when school resumed a few weeks into it, my focus started to wane. Now I'm excited to really build out a few projects 
  to bolster my portfolio, and feel that I am a lot more equipped with a few weeks of focused work in JS under my belt.

  To practice the basics, I started by building a guitar documentation site. I like the aesthetic of the React docs so much, I figured it would be a good UI 
  to imitate to practice different React fundamentals. I also had spent time building a tiny task tracker app, just to get more practice starting a new project 
  using create-react-app, cleaning up the boilerplate files, and then linking together various components. I remember being totally overwhelmed when I started looking
  at React last summer, but I can say that I feel much more in my comfort zone since I've invested time into learning about/practicing more advanced JS concepts like AJAX, 
  webpack, higher-order functions, and module imports/exports.
