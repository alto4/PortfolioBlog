<h3>Polishing up the Task Manager App and Moving Forward</h3>

<p>
  I spent the bulk of my efforts today polishing up the UI and tidying up the code for the Task Manager App.

  While there are still a lot of features I would like to work into the project, I am overall happy with how it turned out in the end and feel eager to move onwards and dive into new projects. 
  Overall I am pretty satisfied with the overall design and layout - although I'd really like to brainstorm a better colour scheme and better fonts.

  After finishing that up, I spent a few minutes being a vanilla JS dropdown menu and learning more about ESLint and the Prettier extension. Although I've used Prettier for a while now, 
  I never dove headfirst into customizing the configurations and I really appreciate the flexibility it affords for customization.

<p>Here is a sample of the project's first iteration: </p>
