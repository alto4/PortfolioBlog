<h3>Day 43: Testing With Jest</h3>

<p>
  Today was a change of pace looking into TDD with Jest.
</p>

<p>
  Although I've heard about the importance of testing time and time again in developer conferences, articles, and videos, it is something that I only dabbled in for a few days last summer. 
  When I was checking out Ruby, I kept being directed to the Ruby Koans, and in that instance I wasn't writing the tests, but had to use rspec to make them pass each Koan. Taking a look at 
  Jest today, I felt like it was going to be a dry topic going in, but quickly saw the benefits once I got rolling with basic test cases.

  The main challenge I worked on was writing unit tests for basic to intermediate algorithms like reversing a string, Caesar's Cipher, and an array reducer to brainstorm test cases, then make them 
  pass by writing the code. This was a neat way to take a step back and think of exactly which use cases need to be accounted for, and in a lot of ways reminded me of a Systems Design course 
  I had taken at Durham College, where each use-case diagram would contain a breakdown of what exactly needed to be accomplished with the code.
