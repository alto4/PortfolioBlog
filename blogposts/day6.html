<h3>Finishing Project 2: Library Application</h3>

<p>
  For Day 6, the bulk of my efforts were spent finishing up the library application. This included getting the book covers to display for each entry, pulling image URLs from 
  the Open Library API, form validation, adding persistent storage with localStorage, as well as adding responsive styles to the project.  
</p>

<p>
  Overall I am happy with the final result, although there is so much more I would like to add to the app. Since this is the third day I've worked on the project, I wanted
   to keep pushing forward with the Odin Project curriculum, and decided to be happy with getting the MVP and stretch goals complete (plus the extra features related to the 
   cover images). In the future, I think I might try to revisit the app to add authentication and connect it to MongoDB to make it a full-stack project, but 
   for now feel comfortable with what's been accomplished.
